```summary
a list of writeups for exploits that I've worked on. It includes work from 
private challenges, HTB, and TryHackMe.

Due to some of the exploits being under private challenges, details have been 
omitted. I am happy to discuss details of building the attack strings, my 
thought process, etc. in interview settings.
